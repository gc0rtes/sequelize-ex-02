Simple Search

Taking the file `sample-query.js` and `sample-data.js` as an example, create a second file called queries.js and try to make functions which:

Searches for all users and logs them -ok

Searches for all TodoItems and logs them (use .toJSON()) - ok

Searches for a user by primary key - ok

Creates a new user. (Once you manage to create this user, delete or comment out the function call as to not run it again, otherwise we'll get an error). - ok

Searches only for important TodoItems - ok

----//---//---

Relations Queries - to do

Get one user by id with his lists.
Get important TodoItems with the name of the list they belong to.
Get one user by id with his lists, which also contain their belonging TodoItem's task attribute.
