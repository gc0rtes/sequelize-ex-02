To build a RESTful JSON API with Express, we have to do the following:

1.  Implement the basic CRUD (create, read, update and delete) actions using the appropriate HTTP methods. Ex:

        // Create a new user account
        app.post("/users", (req, res, next) =>

        // Get a user's information
        app.get("/users/:userId", (req, res, next) =>

        // Update a user's information
        app.put("/users/:userId", (req, res, next) =>

        // Get all user's tasks
        app.get("/users/:userId/lists", (req, res, next) =>

2.  Respond with the correct status codes.

3.  Parse the HTTP request body, when necessary, and use it accordingly.

4.  Define routes that satisfy the REST constraints.

5.  Persist the data (in most cases, anyway).
